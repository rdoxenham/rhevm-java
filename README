RHEV-M Java Implementation
Rhys Oxenham <roxenham@redhat.com>

[About]

This project was started as a hobby to code a new front-end for the
Red Hat Enterprise Virtualisation Manager that doesn't rely on Windows
Presentation Framework (.NET). This implementation is designed to have
a very minimal subset of dependencies and will be lightweight, portable
and easily updateable from the latest upstream code. 

This is purely a work in progress and does not actually function at the
time of writing this README. I will be making contributions to this in
my spare time and would welcome any other developers that would be
interested in taking part.

NOTE: This is *not* a supported Red Hat product, it's a community-extension.

[Building/Using]

All of the source code is provided in the repo for the bleeding edge version,
there's no guarantees of stability but should you want to try out what we
have already, simply clone the repo and execute the very basic build_script.sh
and you will have a deployable .jar file.

Step-by-step:

1) git clone https://github.com/rdoxenham/rhevm-java.git

2) cd rhevm-java

3) sh build_script.sh

4) java -jar rhevm.jar
